source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up your environment variables by creating a `.env` file:
```env
# Discord Configuration
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token
DISCORD_GUILD_ID=your_guild_id
VERIFIED_ROLE_ID=your_role_id

# Choose either Airtable OR Google Sheets configuration

# Airtable Configuration
AIRTABLE_API_KEY=your_airtable_api_key
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=your_base_id

# OR Google Sheets Configuration
SHEETS_SPREADSHEET_ID=your_spreadsheet_id
```

## Database Setup

### Airtable Setup
1. Create a new Airtable base
2. Create two tables:
   - `Member Joins` - For logging new members
   - `Verified Members` - Master list of verified Discord IDs
3. In the `Verified Members` table, create a field called "Discord ID"

### Google Sheets Setup
1. Create a new Google Spreadsheet
2. Create two sheets:
   - `Member Joins` - For logging new members
   - `Verified Members` - Master list of verified Discord IDs
3. Place Discord IDs in column A of the `Verified Members` sheet
4. Set up service account and download `service-account.json`

## Usage

1. Start the bot:
```bash
python discord_bot/bot.py
```

2. Available Commands:
   - `!sync_verified` - Admin only command to sync verification roles with the master list

## Bot Behavior

- Automatically logs all new members joining the server
- Checks new members against the verified list
- Automatically assigns/removes verified roles based on the master list
- Provides detailed console logging for tracking operations
- Handles errors gracefully with try-catch blocks
